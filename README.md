#### So my Mom asked me to make an app for her church.. 

She wants her parisheners to track down good deeds called Acts that are based on three catagories: 
  #### Witness , Kindness and Encouragement

The goal of this app is for each church going member to log in an record thier **"Act"**. 

The main page (app.js) will hold the cumalative acts by the entire church.
 + It will also show random descriptions of members of the church. Currently hard coded. 
 + There is also a **D3.js** bar chart that will show a visual representation towards the total goal of the church. Mom hasn't told me that number yet. :expressionless:

The user will have thier own dashboard (userdash.js) to view thier acts, and they will be able to edit them if need be. 

Each user will be required to register and login.

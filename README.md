#### So my Mom asked me to make an app for her church.. 

She wants her parisheners to track all the good deeds called Acts that are based on three catagories: 
  #### Witness , Kindness, and Encouragement

The goal of this app is for each church going member to log in an record thier **"Act(s)"**. 

The main page (app.js) will hold the cumalative acts by the entire church.

+ On page load, it will also show random descriptions of Acts by members of the church. 
+ There is also a **D3.js** bar chart that will show a visual representation towards the total goal of the church. 
+ The user will have thier own dashboard (userdash.js) to view thier acts, and they can filter thier acts based on act type. 

Each user will be required to register and login.
